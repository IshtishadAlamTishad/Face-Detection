# Face-Detection

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning and computer vision techniques for personalized facial recognition. The primary objective was to detect and identify the faces of group members using a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model integrated with the Haar Cascade classifier.


### Model Training:

A CNN was designed and trained using labeled images of group members.
Class A and Class B images were collected and preprocessed to ensure high accuracy.
The model was trained to recognize and classify faces with precise feature extraction.
Integration with Haar Cascade:

The Haar Cascade algorithm was employed for real-time face detection in video feeds or images.
The CNN model was integrated into the pipeline to identify detected faces as specific group members.
Functionality:

### Input: 
Live camera feed or static images containing group members.

### Output: 
Real-time identification of group members with bounding boxes and names overlaid on their faces.
Tools and Technologies Used:

Python for implementation.
TensorFlow/Keras for CNN model training.
OpenCV for Haar Cascade integration and real-time face detection.

### Challenges:
Collecting high-quality and diverse image datasets for each groupmate to improve the robustness of the model.
Achieving smooth integration between the CNN model and Haar Cascade for accurate detection in various lighting conditions and angles.

### Applications:
Personalized group recognition for attendance systems, access control, or social interaction enhancements.
A foundation for more advanced facial recognition systems in custom environments.
